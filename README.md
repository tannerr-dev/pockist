I am using golang with sqlite on the backend with html, css, and javascript on the frontend. 
Deployed with docker on a five dollar vps.

This is a "vanilla" project, with the least amount of dependencies as possible. 
I chose thie because I want to learn the fundamentals of every "tool" in the stack, 
to be as lightweight as possible and to avoid package driven development.

The idea is to have a self hosted private personal data app for my daily needs.

I know there are probably options for selfhosted apps for these things,
but I am using this as a learning experience and because its fun.
