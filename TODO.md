# TODO LIST
There is no such thing as the 'cloud' it's a remote disk, and it can be your disk if you want. 
Own your own data.

## things to do
### todo
- now that local save is automatic
    - create a 'remote save' button that sends a copy of the local data
        - on each remote save create another entry in the data base with a timestamp
        - the database will keep a history of saves
        - flash 'saved to remote disk'
    - create a 'remote sync' button
        - flashes at latest change
        - or download the new copy and show changes
    - when page loaded with internet connection, check server to see if there is a later copy
        - if there is a later copy prompt user to sync
